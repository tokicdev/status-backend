## Documentation

- All API calls in this app go through the "post" request method.  
- Every request must have a header 'Content-Type' set to 'application/json', and every request's body must be sent in the JSON format.  
- Every response is also sent back in the JSON format.  
- All data is saved onto the cloud database except user avatars and post attachments. They are saved into the '/public' folder.
